# üçÖ Case Study #8 - Fresh Segments

## üßº Solution - Data Exploration and Cleansing

### 1. Update the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` table by modifying the `month_year` column to be a `date` data type with the start of the month

```sql
ALTER TABLE fresh_segments.interest_metrics
ALTER month_year TYPE DATE USING month_year::DATE;
```

### 2. What is count of records in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` for each `month_year` value sorted in chronological order (earliest to latest) with the `null` values appearing first?

```sql
SELECT 
  month_year, COUNT(*)
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
GROUP BY month_year
ORDER BY month_year NULLS FIRST;
```

### 3. What do you think we should do with these `null` values in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics`?

```sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(100 * (SUM(CASE WHEN interest_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) * 1.0 /
    COUNT(*)),2) AS null_perc
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
```


### 4. How many `interest_id` values exist in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` table but not in the `fresh_segments.interest_map` table? What about the other way around?

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT map.id) AS map_id_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT metrics.interest_id) AS metrics_id_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN map.id is NULL THEN 1 END) AS not_in_metric,
  SUM(CASE WHEN metrics.interest_id is NULL THEN 1 END) AS not_in_map
FROM fresh_segments.interest_map map
FULL OUTER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_metrics metrics
  ON metrics.interest_id = map.id;
```

- There are 1,209 unique `id`s in `interest_map`.
- There are 1,202 unique `interest_id`s in `interest_metrics`.
- There are no `interest_id` that did not appear in `interest_map`. All 1,202 ids were present in the `interest_metrics` table.
- There are 7 `id`s that did not appear in `interest_metrics`. 

### 5. Summarise the id values in the `fresh_segments.interest_map` by its total record count in this table

```sql
SELECT 
  id, 
  interest_name, 
  COUNT(*)
FROM fresh_segments.interest_map map
JOIN fresh_segments.interest_metrics metrics
  ON map.id = metrics.interest_id
GROUP BY id, interest_name
ORDER BY count DESC, id;
```

### 6. What sort of table join should we perform for our analysis and why? Check your logic by checking the rows where 'interest_id = 21246' in your joined output and include all columns from `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` and all columns from `fresh_segments.interest_map` except from the id column.


```sql
SELECT *
FROM fresh_segments.interest_map map
INNER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_metrics metrics
  ON map.id = metrics.interest_id
WHERE metrics.interest_id = 21246   
  AND metrics._month IS NOT NULL; 
```


### 7. Are there any records in your joined table where the `month_year` value is before the `created_at` value from the `fresh_segments.interest_map` table? Do you think these values are valid and why?
